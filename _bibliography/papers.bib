      title={Reinforcement Learning for Ultrasound Image Analysis A Comprehensive Review of Advances and Applications}, 
      abstract={Over the last decade, the use of machine learning (ML) approaches in medicinal applications has increased manifold. 
      Most of these approaches are based on deep learning, which aims to learn representations from grid data (like medical images). However, reinforcement learning (RL) applications in medicine are relatively less explored. 
      Medical applications often involve a sequence of subtasks that form a diagnostic pipeline, and RL is uniquely suited to optimize over such sequential decision-making tasks. 
      Ultrasound (US) image analysis is a quintessential example of such a sequential decision-making task, where the raw signal captured by the US transducer 
      undergoes a series of signal processing and image post-processing steps, generally leading to a diagnostic suggestion. The application of RL in US remains limited. 
      Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), that combines deep learning and RL, holds great promise in optimizing these pipelines by enabling intelligent and sequential decision-making. 
      This review paper surveys the applications of RL in US over the last decade. We provide a succinct overview of the theoretic framework of RL and its application in US image processing 
      and review existing work in each aspect of the image analysis pipeline. A comprehensive search of Scopus filtered on relevance yielded 14 papers most relevant to this topic. 
      These papers were further categorized based on their target applications image classification, image segmentation, image enhancement, video summarization, and auto navigation and path planning. 
      We also examined the type of RL approach used in each publication. Finally, we discuss key areas in healthcare where DRL approaches in US could be used for sequential decision-making. 
      We analyze the opportunities, challenges, and limitations, providing insights into the future potential of DRL in US image analysis.},

title={Shoulder Rotator Cuff Tear Detection From Ultrasound Videos Using
Deep Reinforcement Learning},
abstract={Rotator cuff tears (RCT) are common musculoskeletal injuries that significantly impact 
patient mobility and quality of life. Ultrasound (US) is a real-time, cost-effective tool for 
diagnosing RCT, offering dynamic assessment through video sweeps. However, these videos are 
noisy and challenging to interpret, even for experts. They are also often quite long and contain 
redundant frames which make it more timeconsuming for clinicians to identify key diagnostic details. 
To address this, we developed a novel RCT assessment technique using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based 
video summarization approach, where the RL-agent mimics a human expert by analyzing the full video, selecting 
diagnostically relevant frames, and then using CNN to classify the frames as intact or torn. The 
innovative reward mechanism, emphasizing the frame dissimilarity and feature similarity, enhances 
the RL agent’s frame selection process. This reduces computational complexity and storage requirements, 
and simplifies the downstream classification task by focusing only on the keyframes indicative of RCTs. 
Experimental results on 100 patients demonstrate that our proposed classification network achieved 85.0% 
accuracy (90.0% sensitivity, 80.0% specificity) using the RL-generated video summary, outperforming full 
video classification accuracy of 82.5%, while also reducing the training time by 50% (from 8 hours to 4 hours)
, highlighting its potential to assist clinicians in more effective diagnosis. The DRL approach developed in 
this work can be integrated into a low-cost US-AI tool that can reliably identify RCTs, thus improving access 
to imaging, providing earlier disease diagnosis and enhancing patient care.},

  author={M Deekshitha Reddy, Geetika Vadali, Ritu Rani, Poonam Bansal},
  abstract={Rock-paper-scissors is one of the most established imperfect information games in Game theory. The Nash Equilibrium of an RPS game is relatively simple but computationally intractable; hence, various algorithms are employed to converge to a state of maximum payoff. In this paper, five algorithms, namely - Counterfactual Regret Minimization, Monte Carlo Tree Search, Q-Iearning, Deep Q-Network and Proximal Policy Optimization, have been compared on the evaluation metrics of average reward, draw ratio and convergence speed. Throughout the comparative analysis, visualising the learning curves, and qualitative comparison, Q-Iearning has shown the best convergence to Nash equilibrium for RPS.},

title={Spatio-Temporal Crime Detection Using Surveillance Videos in a Federated Setting (in press)},
author={Nikita Shrivastava, Anushka Garg, Geetika Vadali, Ritika Kumari},
abstract={The detection and prevention of criminal and violent activities is a critical task for
enhancing public safety. This paper proposes a novel approach to using surveillance
video data for deep learning-based crime detection in a federated and
distributed setting. Our methodology leverages the SlowFast network architecture
for video’s spatial and temporal feature extraction relevant for efficient violence
identification and classification. By utilising federated learning, the model
ensures that privacy and data security are maintained, as the surveillance videos
need not leave the local devices. Models are trained collaboratively across distributed
nodes, reducing the risk of data breaches in high-priority security tapes.
This makes our methodology potentially scalable to real-time security systems.
The results achieved through this framework outperform previous methods, in
both accuracy of classification and time taken. We demonstrate the efficacy
of this approach by evaluating it on real-world surveillance datasets, where it
achieves high accuracy in detecting spatio-temporal anomalies associated with
crime events, while offering scalability and robustness in a decentralized environment.
Our extensive empirical results have shown that the proposed framework
significantly outperforms traditional classification models, achieving accuracies
upwards of 99% while also significantly reducing training time and computational
resource inefficiency.},

title={Predicting Optimal Startup Exit Strategies with Ensemble Learning for Venture Capitalists},
author={Geetika Vadali, M Deekshitha Reddy, Ritu Rani, Arun Sharma, Amita Dev},
abstract={In the current landscape, Venture capitalists are opting for
more data-driven decision-making to achieve high returns while mitigat-
ing risks. All VCs seek a home run in their portfolio, for which it is
essential to select the optimal exit. The process can be smoothed with
the prediction of the type of exit- IPO, M&A, or the next funding round.
Further, also to gauge which type of exit yields maximum profit for the
particular climate. In this paper, through the utilization of six machine
learning models - Elastic Net, SVR, Kernel Ridge, Gradient Boost, XG-
Boost, and Random Forest, trained on factual data sourced from Crunch-
base, we propose an ensemble learning model with Root Mean Square
Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) score of 0.29 and R-squared score (R2) of
0.76. This weight-averaged ensemble has been validated to predict the
optimal exit for a startup under 6 broad labels - IPO, Acquisition, Lever-
aged Buyout, Merger, Acquihire, and Management Buyout.},
