I am a final year undergraduate pursuing Bachelors in Technology in **Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence**. 

I am based in **New Delhi**, the capital city of India!

I am intrigued by computational fields that aims to explain and bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence. This goes from **Reinforcement Learning to Computational Neuroscience**. I believe that understanding the neural basis of cognition and behaviour can help us in building trustworthy and explainable AI systems. 

I have worked previously with the <a href="https://www.nidusai.ca/">Northern Institute for Deep Learning in Ultrasound (NIDUS) Lab</a> at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada with Prof. Abhilash R. Hareendranathan on integrating a Deep Reinforcement Learning System with Ultrasound imaging and diagnostics. Before that, I had collaborated briefly with <a href="https://www.murtylab.com/">Murty Lab, Georgia Tech</a> on exploring adversarial robustness and its effects on activations inside a ResNet50. I also collaborated with the <a href="https://xulabs.github.io/">Xu Lab, CMU</a> in reviewing previous work on Knowledge Distillation and building a Python script that can isolate and separate single cells from cell cluster images. I have taken up projects with my university around algorithmic game theory, RL and neural machine translation.
