I am pursuing my Masters degree in Computer Science from **Georgia Institute of Technology**.
I currently reside in Metz, France (The Gateway to Europe!)

I am intrigued by computational fields that aims to explain and bridge the gap between human and machine intelligence. This goes from **Reinforcement Learning to Computational Neuroscience**. I believe that understanding the neural basis of cognition and behaviour can help us in building trustworthy and explainable AI systems. 

I have worked previously with the <a href="https://www.nidusai.ca/">Northern Institute for Deep Learning in Ultrasound (NIDUS) Lab</a> at the University of Alberta, Edmonton, Canada with Prof. Abhilash R. Hareendranathan on integrating a Deep Reinforcement Learning System with Ultrasound imaging and diagnostics. Before that, I had collaborated briefly with <a href="https://www.murtylab.com/">Murty Lab, Georgia Tech</a> on exploring adversarial robustness and its effects on activations inside a ResNet50. I also collaborated with the <a href="https://xulabs.github.io/">Xu Lab, CMU</a> in reviewing previous work on Knowledge Distillation and building a Python script that can isolate and separate single cells from cell cluster images. I have taken up projects with my university around algorithmic game theory, RL and neural machine translation. I have also collaborated with a data security startup, <a href="https://www.aurva.io">Aurva</a> in the capacity of a Machine Learning Engineering Intern where I played around with LLMs, RAG and prompt engineering for contextual Q&A, compliance report generation and anomaly detection.
